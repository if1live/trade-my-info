As a data format, YAML may be used as an alternative to JSON.



## [YAML front matter][yaml-front-matter]

> YAML front matter was made popular by Jekyll, the "blog-aware, static site generator" that powers GitHub Pages.

YAML front-matter is optionally used at the beginning of a page to define metadata for the page's content. In order for YAML front-matter to be processed, it _must be the first thing at the top of the page_, and it must be "wrapped" properly using three dashes above (`---`) and three below (`---`).
